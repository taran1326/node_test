Your task is to update the codebase that currently uses CommonJS module syntax for importing 
and exporting. The codebase consits of two files, app.js and math.js. You are required 
to modify both files to comply with the ES6 module syntax. This will involve changing the 
file extension to ".mjs" wherever the ES6 syntax will be used. 

Once the modifications are complete, you should be able to run the file and get 
the expected output on the console.

Expected Output:
The sum is 15
The mean is 3
