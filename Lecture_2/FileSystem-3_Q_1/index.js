// The reason for this issue is the asynchronous nature of Node.js. Since the developer is using non-blocking code, the application does not wait for the file operation to complete before moving on to the next task. This could lead to a race condition where the application tries to read the file before the update operation is completed.

// To resolve this issue, the developer could use callbacks or promises to ensure that the read operation is only performed after the update operation is completed.
