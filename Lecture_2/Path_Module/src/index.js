// Here's an explanation of how the code snippet works:

// The first line of the code imports the built-in "fs" module, which provides an API for interacting with the file system in a Node.js environment.

// The second line of the code imports the built-in "path" module, which provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

// The third line of the code imports a custom module (presumably defined in a separate file called "module.js") and destructures its "getAbsolutePath" function. This custom module is used to determine the absolute path of a given file.

// The fourth line of the code constructs a relative file path to a file called "file.txt" located in a directory called "src". The "path.join" method is used to concatenate the directory and file names and return a cross-platform compatible file path.

// The fifth line of the code calls the "getAbsolutePath" function from the custom module, passing in the relative file path created in step 4. This function should return the absolute file path of the file.

// The sixth line of the code uses the "fs.readFileSync" method to read the contents of the file located at the absolute path returned in step 5. The "utf-8" argument specifies the encoding of the file contents.

// Finally, the seventh line of the code logs the contents of the file to the console.

// In summary, this code reads the contents of a file located in a specific directory by first determining the absolute file path using a custom module, and then reading the file contents using the built-in "fs" module. The file path can be in Unix or Windows format and is constructed using the built-in "path" module to ensure compatibility across platforms.
